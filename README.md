# VanillaJS-PWA
A simple Progressive Web App made with pure JS, HTML, and CSS.
No external libraries, just the fundamentals

## To run:
Since this app uses the fetch api to make an https requests we need to serve it from a server in order to avoid CORS request errors.
The simplest way to do this is by simply starting an https server using python in the root directory (where index.html is).
* open terminal
* navigate to root directory
* `python -m https.server`
